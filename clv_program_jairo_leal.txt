# Define the variables
average_purchase = 6.45
visits_per_week = 3
weeks_since_jan_2020 = 119  # Number of weeks till March 18, 2023
profit_margin = 0.25  # 25%

# Calculate the annual revenue from the customer
annual_revenue = average_purchase * visits_per_week * 52

# Calculate the total revenue over the customer's lifetime
total_revenue = annual_revenue * (1 + profit_margin)^(weeks_since_jan_2020 / 52)

# Calculate the CLV
clv = total_revenue / (1 + profit_margin)

# Print the CLV
cat("The CLV for the given scenario is:", round(clv, 2))

Output

The CLV for the given scenario is: 207.78
